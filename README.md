My first dev project repo

My first project I made a page briefly explaining my history. I used modals to hold information.
I used my html file to layout the base for the site, by adding buttons and divs for later use.
Then I went to my style.css file to turn the display off and style the main sectins of the site.
My last step was to work in the JS file thats where majority of the work was done.
I then used  JQuery to append information inside the modals, I made P sections to input the text I wanted to disply.
I used the .show() method to make the text slide in from the left, I used the .toggle() method to allow me to used a button for more than one function.
The .toggle() method was giving me a hard time trying to figure which function to use with it, I used a couple of things but they all made the 
text appear then seconds later disappear.
